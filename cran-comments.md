## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Ensured formatting of DESCRIPTION file meets CRAN standards (wrapping API and package names in single quotes, and not starting the description with the package name)

* Added value to all function documentation documenting the returned output of each function. 

## R CMD check results
